# EpicList
#### The password list of legends    
This project is an ongoing research into the effectiveness of password lists found online, combining the most popular lists like the "COW.txt", "Cracked.txt" and crack stations "Human_only.txt" lists among around 13 others.
    
Sorting the list took over 2 days with failed attempts on over 3 machines before attempting Kali Linux with success - extracting duplicate entries took over 12 hours of designing custom software to assist in managing the list - with each scan taking in the end over 30 minutes to complete.    

Recapitalisation took over 45 minutes of verifying passwords for capital letters alone on each run - taking 13 hours in total development and sorting to collect the over 95% reduction list.      
 
This list was a Nightmare for cyber security research, but extremely useful for securing the internet with so many hacked databases online these days.      
 
   
> Extensive Password List Collection's, Joined - Sorted and Cleaned from Duplicates - over 15 Cyber Security Password Lists and Database Breaches.
 
Including Lists from the "SecList" and many others.   

 
#### The original file of 1.7Gb was shrunk down to just 1.4 Gb of files by removing Duplicated Passwords.    
  
### Files Information    
Total Size = 1,378,184,079 bytes    
Total Unique Passwords = 120,770,442   

#### Alphabetical  
This file contains all passwords from "a" up until the end of the list was encountered in the entire unique list.

#### Symbolic     
The symbolic file is everything that came before "0" after sorting the entire unique contents ( over 2 hours computing time ).
 
#### Numerical   
This file contains all passwords from "0" up until "a" was encountered in the entire unique list.
 
#### Alphabetical-Split   
This Folder contains each alphabetical letter that was encountered after "a" was encountered in the entire sorted and unique list.

This project was a test to see how effective a password list would be at attacking an account with today's minimum password requirements of,   
- 6 or More Characters
- Capital Letters
- Symbols   
- Lowercase Letters     
     
 With an amazing reduction of over 95% compared to the original list, it is easy to see how most password lists are not designed for specific use case scenarios, some include 4 digit passwords for PIN numbers, others have Extended symbol "only" passwords; all seem to be combined into massive lists of "Unique" but fairly useless passwords.
     
  
### Accessing The List    
The most common way to access the list is using GitHub LFS ( Large File Storage ).    
â€¢ git lfs pull https://github.com/WokeWorld/EpicList    
  
The RAW File links are down for some reason, i think GitHub didn't appreciate my security research efforts when they seem to allow both the "SecList" and "CrackStation" lists.   
 
To download the Modern.txt list containing the most modern requirements for passwords, you can either use `git lfs pull`  or access the MediaFire dump for users that do not have Git LFS installed but would still like to research the final reduction list.

### TO DO,   
> Hash Mapping the EpicList is my next task, hopefully smashing out over 120 Million hashes for searching.
