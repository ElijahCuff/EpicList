# EpicList
The password list of legends   
   
> Extensive Password List Collection's, Joined - Sorted and Cleaned from Duplicates - over 15 Cyber Security Password Lists and Database Breaches.
 
Including Lists from the "SecList" and many others.   

 
#### The original file of 1.7Gb was shrunk down to just 1.4 Gb of files by removing Duplicated Passwords.    
  
### Files Information    
Total Size = 1,378,184,079 bytes    
Total Unique Passwords = 120,770,442   

#### Alphabetical  
This file contains all passwords from "a" up until the end of the list was encountered in the entire unique list.

#### Symbolic     
The symbolic file is everything that came before "0" after sorting the entire unique contents ( over 2 hours computing time ).
 
#### Numerical   
This file contains all passwords from "0" up until "a" was encountered in the entire unique list.
 
#### Alphabetical-Split   
This Folder contains each alphabetical letter that was encountered after "a" was encountered in the entire sorted and unique list.   
 
#### new_rules    
This project was a test to see how effective a password list would be at attacking today's minimum password requirements - with an amazing reduction of over 95% compared to the original list.
     
  
### Accessing The List    
The most common way to access the list is using GitHub RAW file storage.  
Alphabetical,

### TO DO,   
> Hash Mapping the EpicList is my next task, hopefully smashing out over 120 Million hashes for searching.
