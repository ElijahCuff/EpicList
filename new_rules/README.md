## INTELLIGENT CLEANING RULES
#### Most password lists on the internet have been carefully crafted to remove capital letters so as they're bot effective at attacking a network.    
    
#### Common Password Schemes     
> Often, a website will kot accept a weak password, they usually demand a specific password scheme is found in your desired password - for example, most websites will not accept the password "apples" but will accept "Apples123" or "Apples123$" 
    
The most common password expectations can help reduce the EpicList by removing any password that doesn't adhere to modern standards of security.  
    
By checking each password for common expectations of,
• Capital Letter Characters    
• Numerical Characters     
• Symbolic Characters   
• 6 Characters or More    
   
We have reduced the entire list by 95.9% (capitals+digits+symbols) , without excluding passwords that do not contain symbols - the list is still reduced by 62.8 %
This tells me that 60% to 95% of most password lists today are actually useless in modern security implementations, contains millions of 2 character passwords for example. 
 
#### P.S   
When a password was encountered that entirely consisted of lower case characters, the password had the first letter replaced with a capital letter and then it was checked against the rules again before being added to the final file ( my attempt at reversing DE-Capitilised password lists ).
